Sangunetti, N. D. Lawrence and M. Rattray (2006) [Probabilistic Inference of Transcription Factor Concentrations and Gene-Specific Regulatory Activities](http://ml.sheffield.ac.uk/~neil/cgi-bin/publications/bibpage.cgi?keyName=Sanguinetti:chipvar06&printAbstract=1) in Bioinformatics 22 (22) pp 2275-2281\r\n\r\n\r\n### Release Information\r\n\r\nCurrent release is 0.11.\r\n\r\nRelease 0.11 contains a bug fix for file chipVarEstepCMu.m\r\n\r\nRelease 0.1 is the first release associated with the paper, containing\r\nscripts for recreating the results given.\r\n\r\nThe toolboxes required to run the code are listed below.\r\n\r\n**Toolbox**                       |  **Version**\r\n----------------------------------|-------------\r\n[NDLUTIL](/ndlutil/downloadFiles) |   0.15\r\n                                                                      \r\n\r\nFinally you will also need the [NETLAB toolbox](http://www.aston.ac.uk/eas/research/groups/ncrg/resources/netlab/) in your path.\r\n\r\nResults in the Paper\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nThe main scripts are `demTuVar` and `demSpellmanVar` which run the code\r\non the metabolic and cell cycle data sets. Also of interest may be the\r\nscript `demFakeVar` which runs the code on artificial data. `demTuVar`\r\nand `demSpellmanVar` invoke the functions `chipVarEMmu` and `chipVarEM`\r\nrespectively which compute the posterior estimates of the latent\r\nvariables by maximising the variational lower bound on the likelihood.\r\nThe functions used are different as there is no need to estimate the\r\nbaseline expression level for cDNA array data such as the cell cycle\r\ndata set. The scripts output a variable model, containing the parameter\r\nvalues which maximise the likelihood, and expectationsB (posterior\r\nexpectations of the regulatory intensities) and expectationsC, posterior\r\nexpectations of the protein concentration profiles. The function\r\n`chipVarEMmu` also outputs a variable expectationsMu containing\r\nposterior statistics for the distribution of the baseline expression\r\nlevels. The variable expectationsC has four fields: .entropy, a number\r\ncontatining the posterior entropy of the approximating distribution, .c,\r\na matrix with as many rows as transcription factors and as many columns\r\nas time points, .ccT, a 3D array containing the correlations among\r\ntranscription factors at each time point, and .cAltc, a 3D array\r\ncontaining correlations among transcription factors at consecutive time\r\npoints. By specialising the transcription factor index one can obtain\r\nplots of the transcription factor protein concentrations with errorbars.\r\nAn example is show below for the transcription factor ACE2 during the\r\ncell cycle.\r\n\r\n![](ACE2conc.png) \r\n\r\nInferred protein concentration profile for the transcription factor\r\nACE2 during the yeast cell cycle.\r\nSimilarly, expectationsB has several fields, but only two of them are of\r\ninterest for data analysis, .b and .errorbars (the others are necessary\r\nfor the estimation of the variational lower bound). The expectationsB.b\r\nvariable is a matrix containing in each row the regulatory intensity\r\nwith which a gene is affected by each transcription factor. Obviously\r\nmost of the entries will be zero due to the sparsity of the network\r\nstructure. The matrix `expectationsB.errorbars` contains the associated\r\nerror bars. By specifying to a transcription factor, we can obtain a\r\ndistribution of the significance levels of its regulatory intensities.\r\nAn example of this is shown below for the transcription factor ACE2\r\nduring the cell cycle.\r\n\r\n![](ACE2hist.png) \r\n\r\n Significance of the regulatory intensities for the transcription factor\r\nACE2 during the yeast cell cycle.
